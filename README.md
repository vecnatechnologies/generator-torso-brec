# DEPRECATED - use generator-torso

# generator-torso-brec


[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/ "yoeman's website") can scaffold out a new application using prebuilt generators. This generator sets up a project using [backbone-torso](https://github.com/vecnatechnologies/backbone-torso) (a [backbone](http://backbonejs.org)-based framework) and [brec](https://github.com/vecnatechnologies/brec-base) (beautiful, responsive, ergonomic, and configurable) styling and plugins.

You will want gulp globally installed before you begin.

### Install yoeman
```
> npm install -g yo
```

### Install generator-torso-brec
```
> npm install -g generator-torso-brec
```

### Create a new project
```
> cd path/to/project
> yo torso-brec
```

In your current directory, the generator will produce the following files:

    ├─ .gitignore
    ├─ package.json
    ├─ gulpfile.js
    ├─ dist
    └─ app
        ├─ app.scss
        ├─ app.js
        ├─ router.js
        ├─ index.html
        └─ home
            ├─ homeView.js
            ├─ home-template.hbs
            └─ _home.scss

## Pod Generator

When creating an application, generating a new feature typically requires creating a view, template for that view, and sometimes special styling for that view as well. Pods are directories filled with these feature-specific files. Use the pod sub generator to rapidly create a pod pre-filled with a view, template, and scss file.

### Create a new pod
```
> cd path/to/project/app
> yo torso-brec:pod foo
```

This will create the following files:

    └─ foo
       ├─ fooView.js
       ├─ foo-template.hbs
       └─ _foo.scss

If an app.scss file exists, it will add: @import 'foo/foo'; to that file
